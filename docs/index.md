# Tutorial: aws-sam-typescript-bootstrap

This project is an *AWS Lambda function* designed to handle requests for **patient appointments**.
It receives a patient's ID, fetches their appointment data using a structured approach, and returns the information.
The system separates concerns into different layers: **Domain** (like `Patient`, `Appointment`), **Application** (business logic), and **Infrastructure** (data access, like a *mock database* for now).
It also includes utilities for **logging** events and errors, and uses **Jest** for automated testing.


**Source Repository:** [None](None)
